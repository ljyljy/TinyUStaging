  - **Data.** We selected any combination of 'EEG+EOG'. 
  - **Cross-validation**. we applied *5-fold subject-wise cross-validation* on seven datasets totaling above 750G, in each fold, *75%, 10%, and 15%* of the data were utilized to train, validate and evaluate the model. 
  - **Pre-Processing.** We conducted data scaling and data enhancement methods to make the model more robust. 
  - **Model.** We trained a 4-layer U-Net including Encoder, Decoder and Random Window Classifier (RWC) with SE and CSJA module. 
  - **Predict.** We output the confidence scores of each class in the entire RWC. 
  - **Evaluate.** TinyUStaging use metrics including per-class metrics and overall metrics (*accuracy, precision, recall, F1-Score, Cohenâ€™s kappa*).
